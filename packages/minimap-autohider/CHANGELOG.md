# Changelog

## 1.5.4 - Clean up styling/less variable logic (@cbarrick) and basic unit tests

**Patch**

- removed unit tests, config and setTimeout makes them ahrd to deal with
  - maybe later
- visible percentage is now handled by changing a less variable
  - makes for cleaner code
  - matches other config option logic

- changing visible percentage now requires reload, same as transition duration

## 1.5.3 - last change was a hardcore typo

**Minor**

- element !== editor, oops

**Minor**

- editorElement is private, and being removed in the future

**Minor**

- replace yarn with npm@5, because I'm a hipster
