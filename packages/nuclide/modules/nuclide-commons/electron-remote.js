// NB: This file exists to make Flow typing with remote objects more ergonomic.
// Because Flow can't deal with exporting a class unless it's part of the
// top-level `module.exports`, it's easier for us to re-export all of `remote`
// instead of doing Weird Backflips every time we want to declare a variable of
// type `BrowserWindow`
