/**
 * There's a potentially big footgun that can come from using arrow functions for callback refs. It
 * boils down to [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#caveats-with-callback-refs):
 *
 *    If the `ref` callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during
 *    updates, first with `null` and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance
 *    of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up
 *    the new one. You can avoid this by defining the `ref` callback as a bound method on the class,
 *    but note that it shouldnâ€™t matter in most cases.
 *
 * If you're doing non-trivial work in your callback, having it called on every render (instead of
 * just mount/unmount) could be a Big Deal. Hence, this lint rule. If you need to do something other
 * than a simple assignment, extract it into a method so that referential equality is preserved
 * between renders.
