/**
 * A silly no-op style that forces custom scrollbars when scrollbars are set to "always show".
 * A Chromium bug prevents custom scrollbars from triggering a redraw if they load after render.
 * Themes are loaded *after* Nuclide has finished activating, so we're stuck with ugly scrollbars.
 * If we pre-emptively create a custom scrollbar, this mitigates the bug...
 * All major Atom themes use custom scrollbars in "always show" mode.. so this is fairly safe.
 *
 * Will likely be fixed when this patch lands in Electron (Committed on 2017/08/11)
 * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=454346
