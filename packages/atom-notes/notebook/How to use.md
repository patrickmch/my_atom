# ðŸ¤” How to use Atom Notes

Begin typing the query in the search panel. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create a
new note with your query as its title. This package searches for notes whose
body or title contain your query. Naming a new note and searching for existing
notes intentionally occur simultaneously!

While typing a query, Atom Notes automatically filters the presented list by
relevance and also autocompletes note titles by prefix. When an autocompletion
is showing, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the note.

> **Tip:** To _unselect_ a note from your list or to clear an autocompletion,
> press <kbd>Esc</kbd>! Press it again to close the pane.

When the note you want to find is in the list, you can choose it by using the
<kbd>&uparrow;</kbd> and <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> arrow keys. When you press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>, the selected note will appear in your editor.

This package constantly writes your changes to disk as you create and edit notes
when you have the Autosave feature enabled.

> **Tip:** To remove a note entirely: Select any text in the note, delete it
> all, and then save the note. When you close the tab Atom Notes will
> automatically delete the file associated with your now empty note.
