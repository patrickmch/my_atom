# ðŸŒˆ Welcome to Atom Notes!

This package is a fork and rewrite of the now unpublished package
[nvatom][nvatom]. The general idea behind this package is to provide an embedded
[Notational Velocity][nv]-like note-taking feature for Atom users. This package
is **NOT** affiliated with [Notational Velocity][nv].

This is the body of a note. Your notes can be as long or as short as you want.

Notes use [Markdown][md] syntax, so you can freely use features such as
**embolden** or *italicize* in them. Atom's [GFM][gfm] syntax highlighting will
automatically beautify these notes: Use the `Markdown Preview: Toggle` command
to see them!

Hopefully these initial notes give you a sense what you can do with Atom Notes.
Please feel free to delete them at any time.

For more usage tips, see the note [[How to use]].
