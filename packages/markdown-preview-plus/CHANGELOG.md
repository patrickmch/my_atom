## 3.7.1

-   Watch media in link tags
-   Tweak spec for Atom 1.32

## 3.7.0

-   Specs for tab width option
-   Add tab width option for code blocks; use Atom setting by default
-   Added "toggle math rendering" to context menu

## 3.6.3

-   Fix table cell spacing
-   Report uncaught errors in client code

## 3.6.2

-   Fix PDF export when math rendering is disabled

## 3.6.1

-   Respect core editor-font setting in preview code blocks

    v3.6.0 came with an unfortunate side effect of ignoring
    `editor.fontFamily` global config parameter. This patch amends
    that. Bear in mind it does not affect exported HTML (because
    actually supporting arbitrary fonts is very tricky).

    Also note that user stylesheet *is* included with exported
    HTML, so if you really want to force a font (or other style),
    you can do so by specifying it in the user stylesheet directly
    via

    ```less
    atom-text-editor {
      font-family: "My Awesome Font Name, Fallback Font Name";
    }
    ```

    or, if you want to target Markdown Preview Plus code blocks
    specifically, you can use `pre.editor-colors` selector.

-   Fix Pandoc code block non-standard syntax detection

    At some point, Pandoc changed how it assigns class to code
    blocks having syntax class Pandoc doesn't recognize. This
    change updates MPP's highlighting code to respect that.

## 3.6.0

### Changes

-   Preview and HTML export layouts and styles are unified as much as
    possible. Exported HTML should look and feel exactly as the preview
    does (within reason, also see below under Caveats)
-   Got rid of `.markdown-preview-plus` class on `body` in exported HTML
-   Got rid of `data-use-github-style` attribute, now style switching is
    done via loading different stylesheets
-   Styles that are only relevant for the preview are now only imported
    in the preview sandbox, not auto-loaded by Atom
-   Only a limited subset of all styles loaded in Atom is passed through
    to the preview sandbox. See below (under Caveats) for details.

### Fixes

-   Code blocks in PDF now break words if necessary for line wrapping
-   Code block style is the same in preview and exported HTML

### New features

-   New config option `markdown-preview-plus.syntaxThemeName` (called
    'Syntax theme for code blocks' in settings GUI), which allows
    specifying a highlighting theme different from the currently active
    Atom syntax theme
-   `markdown-preview-plus:select-syntax-theme` command which presents a
    menu for setting said config option on the fly
-   New config option `markdown-preview-plus.importPackageStyles`
    (called 'Packages that can affect preview rendering' in settings
    GUI), which allows to explicitly override preview style isolation on
    a per-package basis. See below.

### Caveats

-   Styles not in `atom-text-editor` context and not in user stylesheet
    are not passed through to preview by default. This might lead to
    unexpected interactions (or, more likely, lack thereof) with other
    packages. It's possible to explicitly whitelist a package in
    settings. Examples of packages that might affect preview style
    include: `fonts` package, `language-babel` package,
    `atom-typescript` package, etc. The `fonts` package is whitelisted
    by default. A special value of `*` will pass all
    Atom workspace styles through to the preview and apply some tweaks
    to keep it presentable -- use this at your own risk, however, it's
    impossible to offer any guarantees. Note that HTML export is never
    affected by third-party packages.


## 3.5.0

### Compatibility considerations

-   Tokenization for code blocks has changed slightly due to changes to
    highlighting code. This is a side effect of ensuring compatibility
    with the new Atom grammar parser subsystem.

### Fixes

-   Compatibility with Tree Sitter parsers

    The old way of reusing Atom grammars to highlight code blocks doesn't
    work with the new Tree Sitter parsers (experimental Atom feature).

    This version updates the highlighting code to be compatible with
    Tree Sitter.

    Now the highlighting algorithm will always use the same tokenizer
    as an editor.

### New features

-   New editor context menu item for copying selected Markdown as HTML (Jeremy John)

    This is a simple menu item binding to `markdown-preview-plus:copy-html`
    command. The menu item is called 'Copy Markdown as HTML'

-   Option to enforce using external program to open certain file types

    Until now, all links to local files would be opened in Atom. This
    is obviously not a good idea for binary files. A setting
    was added (`previewConfig.shellOpenFileExtensions`)
    that will force OS default handler for certain files (based on
    file name extension). The setting in question is under 'Preview Behaviour'.

    Default value defines some common binary document types and archives.

    Setting description:
    > **Always open links to these file types externally**
    >
    > This is a comma-separated list of file name extensions that
    > should always be opened with an external program.
    > For example, if you want to always open PDF files (presumably named > `something.pdf`)
    > in system PDF viewer, add `pdf` here

## 3.4.0

### New features

-   'Copy HTML' commands now copy rich text in addition to raw HTML
    source. This can be disabled in settings by unticking 'Use rich
    clipboard' or setting `markdown-preview-plus.richClipboard` to
    `false`.

    With rich clipboard enabled, targets that support rich text (
    word processors, web browsers, etc) will properly format clipboard
    contents on paste instead of pasting raw HTML verbatim.

    Targets supporting only plain text (e.g. Atom) will still get raw
    HTML source.

    See [this comment](https://github.com/atom-community/markdown-preview-plus/pull/419#issuecomment-413947040) for a visual example.

### Maintenance

-   Update to TypeScript 3.0
-   Bump dependencies
-   Bump Atom version (minimal supported is 1.28)

## 3.3.4

-   Do not flash synced element when syncing on change
-   Update generated sources
-   Rework image watcher
-   Reduce dependency on lodash
-   Use native Array.includes instead of lodash.includes

## 3.3.3

-   Display atom-text-editors in preview via flexbox

    Fixes extraneous empty lines in code blocks with long lines

## 3.3.2

-   Do not include display-only CSS into exported HTML

    Fixes indentation display in
    code blocks in exported HTML

## 3.3.1

-   A very specific fix for extra empty line in list items
-   Set charset in preview HTML
-   Bump dependencies

## 3.3.0

### Fixes

-   Fixed disappearing empty lines in code blocks

    Empty lines in code blocks were not rendered in preview  in some
    cases due to somewhat broken CSS styles. This was fixed.

-   Re-render `li` elements completely

    This is a tweak to rendering fix implemented in v3.2.0. Re-rendering
    could sometimes confuse MathJax into inserting rendered math into the
    page several times. Re-rendering `li` elements completely from the ground
    up fixes this problem at the cost of degraded performance for long list
    items.

-   Re-render when math changes from display to inline and vice versa

    Since 3.0.1 and up until this release, math wouldn't be re-rendered when
    changed from inline to display or vice versa.

-   Resize page to paper width when saving to PDF

    When saving to PDF via 'Save As...' menu item or `core:save` command,
    page will be resized to paper size and math will be re-rendered before
    saving. This should make PDF export more robust.

-   Fix copy-html when selection is not empty

    Restored the old behaviour where `core:copy` command on the preview
    copied full preview HTML only if there was no selection inside the preview.

### New features

-   Added basic support for Critic Markup in markdown-it renderer. Disabled by
    default.

-   Added support for specifying image size in markdown-it renderer via
    non-standard syntax `![alt](src "optional title" =<width>x<height>)`, e.g.
    `![A nice picture](image.png =800x600)`.

-   'Save to PDF' feature can be configured in package settings. In particular:

    -   Margins size (default, minimal, or none)
    -   Page size (the usual international and American sizes, or custom size)
    -   Whether to honor or ignore CSS backgrounds
    -   Landscape or portrait orientation
    -   Option to only save selected document fragment to PDF (experimental)

-   Adding two new MathJax options to Atom GUI (#391) (kiwi0fruit)

    Adds options controlling MathJax extensions and `undefinedFamily` parameter
    for HTML-CSS renderer. The latter one controls which CSS font MathJax
    will use for characters that don't have glyphs in MathJax's math fonts.

### Maintenance

-   Only set latex renderer on initialization
-   Clean-up client html
-   Wrap preview in atom-workspace to ensure CSS variable inheritance
-   Update config descriptions
-   Check if package is not active before tests in activation spec
-   Add hack to force spec package activation on OSX
-   Bump twemoji dependency

## 3.2.2

### Fixes

-   Add native PgUP\/PgDN keybindings to webview

    Atom doesn't bind Page Up and Page Down keys to native handler
    by default, consequently those keys didn't scroll the preview.
    The bindings were added, so Page Up and Page Down now should
    scroll the preview as you would expect.

-   Fixup keybindings

    Not all default keybindings were bound to correct scopes, and hence
    some of those didn't work. This was fixed.

-   Fix long copy rendering on atom-beta

    Atom 1.28 updated to Electron 2.0 which changed some rules, and some
    tricks used in offscreen MathJax rendering stopped working. This was
    fixed.

### Maintenance

-   Fix flaky test
-   Clean-up webview-handler
-   Stronger typing in `WebviewHandler.runRequest`
-   Refactor

## 3.2.1

-   Wrap code block lines in print media

    Previously, code blocks with overlong lines would be printed to pdf/paper
    with scroll-bars (which obviously can't be scrolled) and cut-off lines.
    This has been fixed.

## 3.2.0

### Changes

-   Updated MathJax CDN URL in saved HTML

-   Enabled MathJax menu in saved HTML

-   Added accessability extensions to MathJax config in saved HTML

-   Saved HTML will use math config from package settings

    This is mostly related to equation numbering

### New features

-   Context menu item to reopen preview in a new window. Caveats apply

    It's now possible to move a given preview to a new Atom window. For
    file-based previews, this could be done prior by simple tab drag-n-drop.
    For editor-based previews, drag-n-drop doesn't work.

    A new preview context menu option 'Open in new window' and command
    `markdown-preview-plus:new-window` can be used on any preview to
    move it to a new Atom window.

    This can be useful in multi-monitor setups.

### Fixes

-   Force re-render of `li` elements on changes

    In some cases, `li` elements wouldn't be updated properly due to
    weirdness in Chromium. To avoid that, those have to be forcibly re-rendered.
    See [#386](https://github.com/atom-community/markdown-preview-plus/issues/386)
    for details.

-   Disable image fonts in MathJax config

    Reportedly, in some rare cases, MathJax would try to load image fonts, but
    our MathJax for Electron lacks those. The config was amended to tell
    MathJax that it shouldn't look for math fonts.

-   Fix preview reload on settings change

    Preview could fail to reload when some settings were changed (in particular,
    equation numbering)

### Maintenance

-   Reduce copying in UpdatePreview
-   Better request-reply for webview
-   Get saved HTML TeX config from preview

## 3.1.1

-   Fix preview navigating to external URLs
-   When activatePreviewWithEditor enabled, don't activate preview if editor is
    in the same pane as preview

## 3.1.0

### Changes

-   Settings cleanup

    Settings have been reworked to provide better categorization.
    Old package config should be migrated automatically after upgrade,
    but be sure to check just in case.

-   MPP will now disable bundled `markdown-preview` on first activation to avoid
    conflicts.

-   Most package config changes related to rendering will now be automatically
    applied to all open previews instantly.

-   Removed makrdown-pdf compatibility. Since we provide our own PDF export,
    and markdown-pdf not supporting compatibility with MPP by default, and that
    whole code branch being deprecated, this shouldn't affect many users.

### New features

-   Options to relativize media paths on save/copy

    This behaviour is controlled by `saveConfig.mediaOnSaveAsHTMLBehaviour` and
    `saveConfig.mediaOnCopyAsHTMLBehaviour`. Both can have value of:
    -   `untouched` -- media paths will be left as they are in source Markdown
    -   `relativized` -- media paths will be relativized wrt save path (on save)
        or Markdown file path (on copy)
    -   `absolutized` -- media paths will be absolutized. This is the behaviour
        of all previous versions, and bundled markdown-preview.

-   In addition to images, `audio` and `video` tags sources are also resolved
    in the filesystem and are auto-updated on source file changes.

-   Optional support for `markdown-it-table-of-contents` plugin.

    When enabled in package config, `[[toc]]` will be replaced with table of
    contents when using markdown-it parser/renderer.

-   Added 'Print' menu item to preview context menu and
    `markdown-preview-plus:print` command. This will display system
    printing dialog, which will also offer saving to PDF.

-   Continuous scroll synchronization.

    There are two possible synchronization directions:

    -   Autoscroll preview when editor is scrolled

        This is controlled by `syncConfig.syncEditorOnPreviewScroll` setting

    -   Autoscroll editor when preview is scrolled

        This is controlled by `syncConfig.syncEditorOnPreviewScroll` setting

    When both are enabled, preview/editor is autoscrolled only when
    editor/preview respectively is in the active pane. In practice this can
    mean an additional click to engage scroll synchronization.

-   Support for auto-numbered math.

    Note that to support this, all math has to be re-rendered if even one
    equation changes. This can be slow, especially with documents containing
    a lot of math, and re-rendering flicker can be distracting.

### Fixes

-   Fix github-style saved HTML scrollability

    Due to botched CSS style, HTML saved with github style was not scrollable.

-   Fix unneeded reinitializations in markdown-it parser/renderer

    Due to botched check for changed settings, markdown-it was reinitialized
    on every render. Now that this has been fixed, rendering with
    markdown-it backend should be a little bit faster.

-   Labelled MathJax math doesn't break on re-renders anymore. See
    [#180](https://github.com/atom-community/markdown-preview-plus/issues/180)
    for more details

-   Math will only be typeset if there's any unprocessed math. This should
    speed up rendering a tiny bit and it will avoid unnecessary re-renders
    when math numbering is on.

### Maintenance

-   Don't use deprecated sinon.reset()
-   Throw error when trying to saveAs a loading preview
-   Spec for saveConfig configuration
-   Add spec: disable bundled markdown-preview on activation
-   Clean-up pandoc-helper exports
-   Rewrite highlighting spec to be less hacky
-   Avoid global state and more clean-up in markdown-it-helper
-   Clean-up markdown-it-helper
-   Fix mathjax-helper spec
-   Add equation numbering spec

## 3.0.1

### Changes

-   Preview is rendered inside a WebView now

    This provides better isolation.
    As a bonus, `pandoc --standalone`, `pandoc --toc` and `pandoc --css` should
    now "just work", and PDF export is handled by the WebView
    semi-automatically (see below).

-   `openPreviewInSplitPane` option removed. Set `previewSplitPaneDir` to `none
    if you want to disable pane splitting.

-   Math is rendered using SVG renderer by default (due to it being faster).
    You can change to HTML-CSS renderer using package settings.

### New features

-   Save to PDF

    To use this feature, right-click on preview, choose 'Save As...' and use
    a filename with '.pdf' extension.

-   Configurable math renderer (HTML-CSS or SVG)
-   Zoom on ctrl-scroll
-   Open links in preview

    Links to local files will be opened either in Atom, or via system
    opener. URLs will be open with the default browser.

### GUI options

-   Add option to open preview in dock
-   Sync on change
-   Close preview with editor
-   Activate preview when editor activates

### Fixes

-   Skip text{} in inline math
-   Fix outdated JSDoc
-   Fix task list CSS (remove extraneous bullet point)

### Maintenance

-   Clean-up code
-   Bump dependencies (most notably, MathJax updated to 2.7.4)
-   Switch to using morphdom library for diff-updates instead of using "home-grown" solution
-   Stop ignoring package-lock
-   Use atom-ts-spec-runner
-   Disable persistence in spec runner (can lose config on Atom >= 1.25)
-   Fix grammar in README (#356) (Steve Moser)
-   Update styles during differential update
-   Nested math example
-   Member-access, member-ordering
-   Factor MarkdownPreviewView into two subclasses
-   Use old URL parser (less noise)
-   Fix file URL parsing

-   Simplify MathJax rendering a bit
-   Add spinner to placeholder view
-   Bind preview to editor directly instead of via editorId
-   Destroy preview on editor close

-   Add overflow:auto to saved HTML code blocks style
-   Updated spec to not break horribly on new Atom versions

## 2.5.5

-   Make duplicate `attachMathJax` calls safe

## 2.5.4

-   Remove extraneous wrapper in exported HTML

## 2.5.3

-   \[Workaround\] Work around for Atom bug \#16801

## 2.5.2

-   Return support for markdown-pdf... kinda

    You need to enable "Force Fallback Mode" in markdown-pdf settings
    and you might have to run convert command twice. This is deprecated,
    and hardly used by anyone, but until there's a native PDF
    conversion, this should work.
