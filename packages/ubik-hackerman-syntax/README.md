# Become the HACKERMAN!
![Hackerman, Kung Fury](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16547060/22607733/6d0c609a-ea59-11e6-9cc8-2c15ff9db56c.jpg)

Inspired by the retrofuturist aestethics of the 80s, Neuromancer and neon lights.
Hackerman has a dark background and the syntax has bright colors in order to achieve maximum readability.
I strongly recommend leaving the dark background unchanged, coupling it with a dark UI-theme.
(I use ```atom-material-ui``` with neon-pink accent and a black primary)
