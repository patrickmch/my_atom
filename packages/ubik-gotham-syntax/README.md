*__Disclaimer:__
I strongly recommend leaving the dark background unchanged, coupling it with a dark UI-theme.*

## Description

Inspired by the [Gotham colorscheme](https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham), modified and enriched to better highlight code.
Code highlighting is done by altering / adding new colors to the base gotham scheme
and by experimenting with font styling; this is by far still a growing pet project
of mine: as I code more and in more language I will tweak it according to my eyes'
fatigue and aesthetic sense.

Since I mostly code in Python that is where my customization show itself the most.

__SPECIAL:
  Custom Jinja code styling is supported if you use atom-jinja2.__

## Installation

> From the command line: `apm install ubik-gotham-syntax`

> From Atom, go to __Settings__ --> __Install__ --> __Themes__ --> type in __ubik-gotham-syntax__

If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Happy Coding!

Ubik
