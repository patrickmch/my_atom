# Style Review

Our styles need consistency for us to move front end projects forward efficiently. Pages designed differently each time will quickly lead to inconsistencies throughout the site and spaghetti code. Ideally, we would have a process whereby creative uses elements that exist already on previous pages, and our job will entail assembling these pieces in to functional pages.

On the IS side, we will need to resolve to use Foundation markup, the NOLS style guide, and inherit styles from higher level sheets. We should put custom css in consistent locations, and document it well. The less css we write ourselves, the better!
