# Django Widgets
I'm trying to improve the ChoiceWithOtherRenderer so I can apply classes to it in the template rather than in the widget class itself.

So far I've been trying to send a list of fields to unpack in the template using a loop. This simply displays the list itself as raw text (ie. `<div class="radio small-5 columns"><input checked="checked" id="id_amount_0_0" name="amount_0" type="radio" value="25" /> <label for="id_amount_0_0">$25</label></div>`) rather than showing radio buttons.

I'll continue to try to unpack values in a loop in the template as I think this would provide more readable and maintainable code.

Unpacking values led me to some interesting places (for example, generators). Right now I'm getting a `TypeError` that says subwidget not iterable when I try a nested `for` loop in the template. I feel less pressure since Steve and I had a check-in. He basically said my job over the next few months is to work on understanding what I'm doing rather than just forcing it.

I also learned that we use the Django Debug Toolbar which has been helpful. I now have some code in my local settings file that turns this feature on. 

*N.B.* That this came from my realization that we use Django Widget Tweaks in other places throughtout the site. Since Eryn asked for some changes that relate to the ChoiceWithOtherField, it seemed like a good refactoring opportunity.
