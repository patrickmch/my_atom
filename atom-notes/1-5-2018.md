# Django Widgets
I'm trying to improve the ChoiceWithOtherRenderer so I can apply classes to it in the template rather than in the widget class itself.

So far I've been trying to send a list of fields to unpack in the template using a loop. This simply displays the list itself as raw text (ie. `<div class="radio small-5 columns"><input checked="checked" id="id_amount_0_0" name="amount_0" type="radio" value="25" /> <label for="id_amount_0_0">$25</label></div>`) rather than showing radio buttons.

I'll continue to try to unpack values in a loop in the template as I think this would provide more readable and maintainable code.

N.B. That this came from my realization that we use Django Widget Tweaks in other places throughtout the site. Since Eryn asked for some changes that relate to the ChoiceWithOtherField, it seemed like a good refactoring opportunity.
