# Styles Review
We basically just discussed the process for overhauling the styles and making them consistent. It included some things that Creative wants to do in the future (ie. redesign the tables that Wild Med uses to compare their programs). Eryn took down the specifics, but I'd say the biggest thing that we decided was that we should have more bare bones styles applied to generic features and then have a list of classes that we then apply to those elements. I'd say that this can work if we document the styles that are in use (ie. what classes we have), organize them carefully, and are careful to remove some styles when others come in to use.
