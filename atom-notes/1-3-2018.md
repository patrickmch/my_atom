# Meeting With Eryn
## What to Change on Giving
### Giving:
- [ ] center “or”
- [ ] arrow should be black
### Credit-card:
- [ ] put ‘make this monthly donation’ checkbox inside of radio div to reduce space between radios and make this monthly donation checkbox
### Authorize:
- [x] change grey font to a larger size
- [x] consistent margin
- [x] wording change for payment button
### Thank you:
- [ ] link instead of button
- [ ] make sure link is aligned left
### Next steps:
Eryn is going to talk with Nicole when she gets back about getting our pages consistently styled and perhaps getting them inline with the Hubspot pages as well. I need to review places where styles are inconsistent.
