# Meeting With Eryn
## What to Change on Giving
### Giving:
- [x] center “or”
- [x] arrow should be black
- [x] make sure there is an actual link (https://www.nols.edu/en/alumni/giving/ways-giving/)
- [x] link should be higher up to the paragraph text
### Credit-card:
- [x] put ‘make this monthly donation’ checkbox inside of radio div to reduce space between radios and make this monthly donation checkbox
### Authorize:
- [x] change grey font to a larger size
- [x] consistent margin
- [x] wording change for payment button
### Thank you:
- [x] link instead of button
- [x] make sure link is aligned left
### Next steps:
Eryn is going to talk with Nicole when she gets back about getting our pages consistently styled and perhaps getting them inline with the Hubspot pages as well. I need to review places where styles are inconsistent.
