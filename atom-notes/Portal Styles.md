# Portal Styles
Right now we seem to be facing a trade off- doing things one way vs. flexibility. I'm not entirely sure the way that I've chosen to do this makes sense. If we add all those classes to portal styles it's going to be harder to develop the portal in the future. You're going to have to add up to three new classes to match the styling on the rest of the portal every time and remembering to do so is unrealistic. People will face a temptation to add new classes for a certain way of doing things.
Of course, adding these classes makes it consistent with the rest of the site. We can start to hack a way at the other portal styles, knocking them down so that the site is more consistent across the board. I guess the question is whether the portal is really better after these changes or whether it's just more consistent.
