## Meeting With Steve @10AM

Mostly,  I got some items to work on. We also talked about how I would likely work on refactoring staffing's SPE process to use the API (moving away from NOLS Model Core). He called the meeting to use the api_csv_script.py that I wrote to import HubSpot data in to Nexus. The script worked fine with one minor tweak to allow the correct date format.

## TODO (I moved this to the [Master TODO](./Master TODO List.md))
- [ ] Get in touch with Cristina about the imports
  - [ ] Make sure that she checks off that it is correct in Nexus
  - [ ] Ask Steve for the password that he set for her in nexusclone (password)
  - [ ] The link is http://nexusclone.nols.edu/nexus/#people/10622203
  - [ ] Import the file in to production
  - [ ] Confirm that it's in production
- [ ] Write a basic command line interface for the imports
  - [ ] You can look in the scripts files to get some ideas
  - [ ] Should have a username/password interface
- [ ] See if you can use Python3 (probably won't require changes, just make sure it's using py3)
- [ ] Find other Python2 dependencies and just keep track of what they are
