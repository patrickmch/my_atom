# Weekend Work:

I put in three hours on Saturday. There was a bug in the WRAP process (see help desk ticket 59791) and no one could submit WRAPS. Essentially, the form validation had a problem with a new field we put in (`applying_for_wild_med_work`). For instructors who also work for wilderness medicine the field should show. For every one else it should not, but the validation expected a field even though the form didn't show it, and returned an error to the user. I fixed the bug, and Emily Chien came in to help me deploy it to production since I'm still learning how to do that.
