# How to Refactor the Styles

After talking to Emily, it seems like the least bad way to proceed with the styles will involve keeping the styles as they exist on the CMS now and finding a way to apply the other styles only on certain pages. That way we can go through and refactor bit by bit.

This might look like this: we find where we need to use these styles and have a SCSS script that inherits from the base, but overides certain styles (ie. headings).

Issues with this would stem from us not moving the old styles out, conitnuing to develop new projects using the old styles, and ending up with a half done refactor with more work on our plate than we had initially. Another possible problem with this approach could see us refactoring the styles almost completely with just a few 'orphans' hanging on. I think neither of these is particularly likely if we are dilligent.
