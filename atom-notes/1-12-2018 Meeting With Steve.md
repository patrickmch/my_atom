# Weekly Meeting

Steve and I talked about:
- How I would have to reschedule the meeting with creative on styles
- The calendar widget for staffing (see my Staffing Calendar Widget notes or [issue 125 on GitHub][8214acad]). Specifically:
  - It may or may not be something we care to move forward on.
  - It may work well with the idea of having a calendar widget that shows instructors all the courses they can work in a season and pairs down as they select blackout dates
  - I need to look in to other calendars currently used in the portal and use on of those for this project
- Two other tasks for me:
  - making sure pdb traces stay out of commits (ie. when someone commits, check to make sure no pdb statements exist in the code)
  - looking in to why we can't keep open gui test browser windows when the tests are done running and fail
- An import tool that I wrote to use the new api about a month ago might be put in to use next week.
