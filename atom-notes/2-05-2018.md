# Weekend Work

I worked this weekend for 7 hours on Sunday. I tried to get some tests in the WRAP process but I struggled to figure out certain things (and am still struggling today). What I worked on was:
- Trying to get a test user in the system.
- I looked in some wrong places. At first I looked in open/apply, and when I copied some of that code I spent a few hours trying to make it fit in to the WRAP process.
- Pretty soon I realized that it would be way easier (after looking in the Alumni tests that Suresh wrote- TestAlumniBenefits) to just pass in WebsiteUserMixIn from website.tests.
- Finally I ended up trying to get a test to work with this, forgetting that I didn't need to super() all the methods that were in there, and actually ended up with something pretty simple.
- In the end I created a test user that just needed to be logged in but couldn't get it working until this morning (Monday)
All in all not the most productive weekend, but I was working solidly from 11-4, then from 5:30-7:30
