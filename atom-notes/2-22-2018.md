# Heading Refactor

Still in the process of refactoring the css. The fact that I don't totally understand SASS and our codebase has got this project taking longer than I'd hoped. It has turned in to part of a full blown refactor, that I hope will make it easier to change things in the future. Not that they did a bad job from the get-go.

Anyhow, what I currently don't undertand is how to undertake this piece by piece. We need to make some changes that exist independently of the rest of the code so that we can proceed slowly. I want to set a process up that makes the rest of the styles refactor smooth as well. Specifically, I'd like to unset any of the styles that apply to the heading tags in one file, ensuring that the old styles apply to the site, and that we can use the new styles simply by importing a file. I'd really like to avoid applying classes that will go away soon to the HTML and I'd like to avoid having to wrap the CSS in pre-existing tags to get it to work with styles on specific pages (though it may come to that).

I have considered the following:
- `all: unset;` It lacks browser support.
- Some type of js: this could add to page load times.
- Going in piecemeal (ex. `margin: 10px;` etc)and removing all the styles: could take a while, and really would suck to do this with the whole refactor
