# Tuesday Meeting

## What I've Worked On
- Submitted PR for giving pages
  - Working on some code revisions for that
- Looking in to staffing calendar potential
  - Old feature request
  - Have instructors fill out their blackout dates on an actual calendar when submitting their WRAPS
  - This would pave the way for a broader feature that would let them see what contracts are available and what contracts they will preclude themselves from working by selecting certain blackout dates.
- Working with Cristina Edwards to import applications coming in from HubSpot
  - I wrote this script a while back as a way to import csv files with contact info in to Nexus using the API
  - This will be ongoing- eventually I'll make a version of this that she can run on her own after making sure the first few imports go smoothly
- Looking in to where we have Python2 dependencies and keeping track of them for the future

## Meeting With Ledingham and Jessie (staffing)
- Jessie was asking for some way to link the WRAP process with the seminar process
  - Emily noted that the WRAP process works well with seminar process in terms of career planning
  - Steve mentioned that we could first do an online seminar app
- Staffing is interested in our blackout date project
  - Still want some context for the blackout dates (ie. they should have the ability to provide info on the why/how firm blackout dates)
N.B that this was added to TODO list
- Make sure I can test WRAPS
- Work locally to Add in WildMed stuff
  - Use API to query the db and see if they are a WildMed instructor
    - Will require adding a dependency to NOLS API Client
    - Anything that is not on SPEs or Person talk to Steve
  - Show field if they are WildMed instructor
  - Show staffing draft and get the verbage right
  - Add field to script that will dump all the WRAP data (it will export the WRAP data to CSV for staffing)
- After this you will be refactoring SPEs so that the they are getting data from the API rather than data access
