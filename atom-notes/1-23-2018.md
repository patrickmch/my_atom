# Tuesday Meeting
## What I've Worked On
- Pushing giving out
  - First time I'm pushing those out
  - Some changes took longer than expected
- Putting in option for instructors on the WRAP to let staffing know if they are applying for wmi work
  - Use API to determine if they are wild med instructor which will determine whether they see the box or not
  - Have a draft on that
- Finishing script for AO Cristina
  - Strange issue where there were some differences in production vs develop so haven't gotten that figured out

## Working on Getting the Wild Med Instructor Stuff Going
So I have some code that I'm ok with. It's nothing great, and that's probably fine. I think it's pretty clear and readable.
What I'm running in to now are just some issues with consistency between data in my 'local' test database and the data in the api database. When I go to test as the normal locahost user (mchey), it fails with a 404 as soon as it hits the block of code sending my user id (5) to the api requesting data back. I feel pretty confident, without totally understanding how the infrastructure is set up, that these systems are running with two slightly different data sets. The users in test are created locally (I'm pretty sure), so they don't exist on the main test database.
I think I need to create two users that have the same data in testbase and locally. Not quite sure how to do that yet.
It's also totally possible that I'm incorrectly assuming that user.id is the same as the personId.
