These changes:

* Clean up templates
  - Factor context variables out of templates and in to the view
  - Reduce/organize the JavaScript in templates
  - Create a generic modal template for forms
* Reduce some unused code in the views
* Make small aesthetic tweaks (ie. removing colons, fixing a button, changing wording)

The next PR that I do for the Rollcall process will involve more cosmetic updates.
