# HubSpot
NOLS uses [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) to collect information about prospective students. You can navigate to [info.nols.edu](info.nols.edu) to see the main landing page.
You'll notice that info.nols.edu looks similar to the NOLS website. This presents challenges because info.nols.edu is hosted on HubSpot's servers, over which we have minimal control, and yet we need to maintain the look and feel of the NOLS website. Fortunately, Creative does most of the work to make it look pretty. Every once in a while, however, we have to get involved.
## Styles
The majority of the styles info.nols.edu uses are pulled directly from `screen.css` that lives at nols.edu. A few custom stylesheets exist and (as of April 2018) can be confusing and a bit messy.
